Configuration for programs I use

## Keybindings

I like ErgoEmacs shortcuts [1] for movements and edition in the text editor. the basic idea is to 
have the movements (left, right, up, down) mapped to IKJL with left ALT. This allows for a natural 
movement without moving the hand from the typing position. Something like the typical gamer's WSAD
but for your right hand.

I K J L move up, down, left, right

U O move by word to the left or right

All movements with SHIFT do selections

D F delete before and after cursor

E R delete a word before and after cursor

G H delete to the end and beginning of the line
